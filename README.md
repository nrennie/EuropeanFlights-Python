# European Flights

This repository contains the code for a Python Shiny app to display data on European flights from [Eurocontrol](https://ansperformance.eu/data/), via the [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) repository.

The Shiny app is deployed at [keen-peony-5c6a8c.netlify.app/](https://keen-peony-5c6a8c.netlify.app/).

An R version of the same Shiny app is deployed at [nrennie35.shinyapps.io/EuropeanFlights](https://nrennie35.shinyapps.io/EuropeanFlights/).
